## Info
Offers 2 gamemodes:
1. Player vs CPU (1 Player)
- You'll be playing against a CPU where it will place symbols after you've inserted something in a cell
- The CPU will instantly place the symbol after you've inserted your symbol
2. Player vs Player - (2 Players)
- Each player will take turns to place the symbols on the grid.
- For instance, Player 1 will place their symbol first, followed by Player 2.

### How to use:
Once you've started the bot, you will be brought to a new 'room' created for you to manage the game.
<br>
In the 'room', you'll firstly get to choose a game mode, select a symbol (i.e. X or O) and then finally start playing!
<br>
This is to let each user player play their own game separately to prevent clashes from happening.

In the game, choose between 1-9 and the symbol will be inserted into the corresponding numbers below:
<br>
<code>
1 2 3
</code>
<br>
<code>
4 5 6
</code>
<br>
<code>
7 8 9
</code>
<br>

Commands:
/start - Starts a new game
<br>
- This will bring you into a game 'room' that will be created for you to play tic tac toe<br>
/quit - Quits the game<br>
- This will take you our of the game 'room' which was once created after you typed down the /start command
